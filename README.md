Overview
--------
OKUnwrap is a fully automatic curvature-based UV unwrapping add-on for Blender.
It is a perfect solution for situations when manual UV unwrapping is too time consuming or impractical.
Add-on is easily scalable for batch asset processing.

This add-on aims to speed up automatic unwrapping, by producing significantly better seam layouts, and being more user friendly, especially compared to built-in solutions.

Main features:

*   Unwrapping quality better than built-in Blender solutions, and often better than proprietary solutions.
*   Works on any geometry, even triangulated from automatic poly-reduction.
*   Minimum small islands that waste space when packing and baking.
*   Fully multi-threaded.
*   Production-ready speed - 335k triangle testing mesh unwraps in 3.7 seconds on a 12-core 4.7 Ghz CPU.
*   Windows, Linux and macOS are supported.
*   Works on any Blender version since 2.8.
